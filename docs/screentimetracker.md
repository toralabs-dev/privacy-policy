# Privacy Policy for Screen Time Tracker

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Overview

Screen Time Tracker ("the App") is available as an Android app and a Chrome browser extension. It is designed to help you understand and manage your screen time. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

This policy covers both the Android app and the Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

The App collects the following information **locally on your device only**:

- **Usage statistics**: Time spent on tracked applications or websites, session counts, and session durations
- **App package names** (Android): Technical identifiers for installed applications (e.g., "com.instagram.android")
- **Website hostnames** (Chrome extension): Domain names of visited websites (e.g., "youtube.com") — never full URLs or page contents
- **Focus Mode settings** (Android): Your configured focus schedules, blocked apps, and related preferences
- **App preferences**: Your daily limits, notification settings, theme preferences, and tracked app/site selections

### What We Do NOT Collect

- We do NOT collect personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- We do NOT collect location data
- We do NOT collect contacts or messages
- We do NOT collect photos, videos, or files
- We do NOT collect device identifiers for tracking purposes

## Data Storage

**All data is stored locally on your device only.** We do not operate any servers and do not transmit any data from your device to external services.

- **Android**: Usage statistics are stored in a local SQLite database; user preferences are stored using Android DataStore
- **Chrome extension**: All data is stored in `chrome.storage.local` on your device
- No data is synced to the cloud or backed up to external servers

## Data Retention

- **Android**: Usage data is retained for up to **365 days** on your device
- **Chrome extension**: Usage data is retained for up to **90 days**
- Older data is automatically cleaned up to save storage space
- You can delete all data at any time through Settings > Clear All Data

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data with third parties.** Since all data remains on your device, there is no data to share.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not include:
- Analytics SDKs
- Advertising SDKs
- Crash reporting services
- Any other third-party tracking or data collection tools

## Accessibility Service

The App uses an Android Accessibility Service for the Focus Mode feature. This service:

- **Purpose**: Detects when you open a blocked app during a focus schedule and displays a blocking overlay
- **Data accessed**: Only the package name of the currently foreground app
- **Data stored**: Block events are logged locally for your reference
- **Data shared**: None - this information never leaves your device

The Accessibility Service does NOT:
- Read your screen content
- Access your keystrokes
- Monitor your activities outside of app launches
- Send any data to external servers

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The App is intended for general audiences and contains no content inappropriate for children.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: All your data is visible within the App
- **Delete**: Use Settings > Clear All Data to permanently delete all stored information
- **Portability**: All data remains on your device and can be managed through standard Android backup features

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
